Hello, my name is Taylor Pitman! I am in my final semester at SUNY New Paltz, pursuing a degree in Computer Science. Originally from Middletown, NY, 
I spent two years in Syracuse, where I earned my Associate’s degree in Computer Science from Onondaga Community College before returning to the Hudson Valley.
Currently, I work in the produce department at Health and Nutrition and live in town with my two roommates and my cat, Oreo, who is the light of my life.

I’ve completed all the required undergraduate Computer Science courses, except for the Projects course I’m taking this semester. 
Last semester, I had the opportunity to take Machine Learning and Web & Database Programming, which solidified my passion for web development.
One of my recent projects is a rebrand for the NYS ACE Women’s Network website. I collaborated with Graphic Design student Olivia Wilson to overhaul the 
website’s design, and I’m in the final stages of development. The updated site will be live soon: https://nyacewomen.org/.

Additionally, I created my portfolio website last semester: https://taylorpitman.com/. However, I’m already excited to redesign it to incorporate new 
skills I’ve learned recently.

I’m looking forward to strengthening my web development skills through this course, especially learning more about Vue as a framework.
